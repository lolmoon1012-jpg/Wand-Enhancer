# Changelog

This file is the source of truth for release notes.
The newest entry must match the version in `WandEnhancer/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`.

## [1.0.9.0] - 2026-06-15

### Features

- The Remote Web Panel now shows mod names, descriptions, and instructions translated to your WeMod account language. #98
- Added a language selector to the Remote Web Panel (English, Russian, German, French, Spanish, Simplified Chinese) with automatic detection from the browser language.

### Improvements

- Release builds are now code-signed, which reduces false-positive antivirus and VirusTotal detections.
- Reworked the Remote Web Panel internals around feature capabilities for easier maintenance, with no change to existing behavior.

## [1.0.8.4] - 2026-06-10

### Fixes

- Fixed QR code issues on the latest Wand version.
- Fixed application hang that occurred after Wand updates with pending patches.

## [1.0.8.3] - 2026-06-06

### Fixes

- Fixed the Remote Web Panel patches so they reliably apply on newer Wand builds by making the remote bridge patch anchors version-resilient.
- Fixed Pro activation being lost after changing the app language; the account language endpoint now keeps the patched subscription.
- Fixed "WeMod directory not found" when Wand/WeMod is installed outside the default location or only one brand folder exists. The patcher now also resolves the install directory from a running Wand/WeMod process. #82
- Hid the Pro "Remote" onboarding card in the Explore Pro benefits dialog. #86

## [1.0.8.2] - 2026-05-15

### Fixes

- Rolled back an incorrect Disable Updates patch fix that introduced a `SyntaxError` preventing Wand from launching.

## [1.0.8.1] - 2026-05-15

### Fixes

- Fixed a syntax error in the Disable Updates patch that prevented Wand from launching. #70
- Fixed an issue where the Remote Web Panel WebSocket connection wouldn't automatically reconnect when turning returning to the app or turning on the screen.
- Reduced battery consumption and device heating on mobile device by optimizing heavy UI blur effects and eliminating unnecessary React re-renders in the Remote Web Panel. #67

## [1.0.8.0] - 2026-05-06

### Features

- Added the My Games list to the Remote Panel with remote start and stop actions.
- Improved the Remote Panel with new UI and overall UX.

### Improvements

- Optimized and sped up patching and ASAR unpack/pack operations.

### Fixes

- Fixed in-place handling of unpacked `app.asar.unpacked` assets during packing to avoid locked-file failures.
- Fixed local network IP detection for QR-based Remote Panel pairing, so the app no longer picks Cloudflare, VMware, and similar non-LAN adapters by mistake.

## [1.0.7.0] - 2026-05-01

### Features

- New Remote Web Panel: control local app features from a phone or another PC over the local network via QR code connection. #37

### Fixes
